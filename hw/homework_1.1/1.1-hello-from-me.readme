1.1 Hello from you (2-pt)
Write a C++ program to print the following banner to the console:

+---------------------------+
| Hello from (your name)    |
| Have programmed in:       |
| (List languages you know) |
+---------------------------+ 

Specific requirements:

    You must print those "+-|" characters that make up the boundary of the banner
    There is a space between the left edge and the first character of each string
    You could output more than 3 lines of text in total, but see below
    You must make the banner wide enough to accommodate the longest string, but not too wide for it to have more than one trailing space
    Important: you must achieve the above in an automatic way,
        That is, you don't manually assign fixed number of '-' or spaces, or a literal string, to have a fitting boundary
        In other word, your program would always generate a fitting boundary with any reasonably-sized string for the third line.
        Hint: you may use the string class (from <string>), which has a member function .length()
    It's up to you on whether to create helper functions, though it's recommended
